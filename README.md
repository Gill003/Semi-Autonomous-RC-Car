# Semi-Autonomous-RC-Car

## Description

I developed and designed an RC car from scratch, incorporating semi-autonomous features such as adaptive cruise control and low-speed emergency braking. Driven by a passion for software development and automotive engineering, I integrated these interests into a project that aims to advance the capabilities of remote-controlled vehicles.

The RC car is built around an Arduino Nano microcontroller. For steering, I implemented a servo motor at the front wheel shaft and for the movement, I used 2 DC-encoded motors controlled using a L293D quadruple half-H driver. I designed and tested different prototypes on AutoCad and printed them using a 3D printer.

I used an SPI communication protocol on nRF24L01 modules, allowing seamless communication with the controller and the car. The controller has two joysticks for manual control of the carâ€™s movement. For the Advanced Driver Assistance System (ADAS) features, I used an  HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor at the front of the car to detect the distance of objects in front of the car which allowed me to implement low-speed braking and adaptive cruise control.
 an HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor is employed to enable adaptive cruise control and low-speed emergency braking.
